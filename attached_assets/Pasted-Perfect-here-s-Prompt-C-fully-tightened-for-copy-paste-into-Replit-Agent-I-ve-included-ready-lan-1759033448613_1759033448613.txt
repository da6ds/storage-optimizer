Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs Prompt C, fully tightened for copy-paste into Replit Agent. I‚Äôve included ready landing page copy so it updates /docs/copy.md directly along with the other docs.

Prompt C ‚Äî Fix landing, gating, flows + expand savings model & recommendations

(plan only, no code)

Update /docs/copy.md, /docs/wireframes.md, and /docs/ux-flow.md with the following changes:

‚∏ª

Landing Page (for users not logged in):
	‚Ä¢	Show app name + tagline:
	‚Ä¢	StorageMap
	‚Ä¢	See it all. Clean it all.
	‚Ä¢	Headline: Take control of your storage
	‚Ä¢	Subcopy: Link your devices and cloud accounts to see all your files in one place. Then, with one tap, let us clean it all up and cut your storage costs ‚Äî automatically.
	‚Ä¢	Bullets (expectations):
	1.	Link this device
	2.	Link your accounts
	3.	Optimize your storage
	‚Ä¢	Primary CTA: Get started ‚Üí Link this device
	‚Ä¢	Secondary CTA: Log in ‚Üí (for existing users)

‚∏ª

Gating / Data Visibility Rules:
	‚Ä¢	No simulated data, score, or savings shown until at least one device is linked.
	‚Ä¢	Any suggestive step (‚ÄúLink this device to begin‚Äù) is tappable and routes into the linking flow.
	‚Ä¢	Visual Map:
	‚Ä¢	If nothing linked ‚Üí empty icons only; tapping them routes to connection flow.
	‚Ä¢	Once linked ‚Üí icons become interactive (tap = info drawer, long-press = refresh).

‚∏ª

Choose Plan Page:
	‚Ä¢	Must be scrollable.
	‚Ä¢	Allow selecting a plan and moving forward to confirm.

‚∏ª

Savings model (simulation + UI):
	‚Ä¢	Cap monthly savings at ‚â§ 40% of current spend unless a provable cheaper plan exists post-cleanup.
	‚Ä¢	No double counting: deduped bytes aren‚Äôt counted again for plan downgrades.
	‚Ä¢	Subtract migration/egress overhead for archive moves (month 1).
	‚Ä¢	Compute optimal plan as smallest tier that fits post-cleanup usage with 15% headroom.
	‚Ä¢	If provider = 0 GB, surface ‚ÄúClose or pause account‚Äù as optional rec with deep link (never auto-close).

‚∏ª

Actions Page (recommendation set):
Keep list short, clear, and measurable. Each card shows:
	‚Ä¢	GB saved
	‚Ä¢	$/mo impact (after plan change)
	‚Ä¢	One-time costs (migration/egress, if any)

Recommendations include:
	‚Ä¢	Remove exact duplicates (count + GB)
	‚Ä¢	Move large, rarely opened videos to archive
	‚Ä¢	Keep project files in one place (consolidation)
	‚Ä¢	Downgrade plan where eligible (show new tier + $/mo delta)
	‚Ä¢	Close/disable unused provider (only if 0 GB remains; caveats shown)

‚∏ª

Redundancy (respect earlier rules):
	‚Ä¢	Never drop below chosen copies.
	‚Ä¢	Convert extras into cold backups instead of deleting.
	‚Ä¢	Copy explicitly says: ‚ÄúYou will still have {{n}} copies after this.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Acceptance Criteria:
	‚Ä¢	Landing page with login + 3 bullets is restored.
	‚Ä¢	Score/Savings only appear after device link.
	‚Ä¢	Visual Map gating works (empty state vs interactive state).
	‚Ä¢	Choose Plan page is scrollable + functional.
	‚Ä¢	Actions page shows GB/$/one-time cost on every card.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúClose/disable provider‚Äù only shown when usage = 0 GB.
	‚Ä¢	Redundancy copy is clear and enforced.

üëâ Copy this whole block into Plan mode in Replit Agent.

Do you also want me to prep the Prompt D (for the full Visual Map build with totals/unique/dupe, file-type breakdown, etc.) right after this, so you can queue them back-to-back?
