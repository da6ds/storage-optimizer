Continue planning — generate the full docs set now (no code):
Create the six files with the exact structure below. Use simple, direct language. Include ASCII wireframes. Keep everything Simulation Mode–only.
/docs/ux-flow.md
Sections: Overview · Personas · Onboarding (2 Qs) · Free tier journey · Upgrade journey · Pro journey · Done/History.
Include a single-page flowchart (ASCII) from first launch → Done.
Call out where Estimated Savings banner + Upgrade CTA appear on each tab.
/docs/upgrade-flow.md
Steps: Choose plan ( $10 one-time | $5/month ) → Confirm → In-app checkout → Success → Enable actions → Optional Backup add-on → Progress → Done.
Show copy for: buttons, footnotes, error messages, cancellation, and success.
Include an ASCII stepper with states and what the screen shows.
/docs/navigation.md
Fixed tabs: Map · Duplicates · Costs · Actions (always).
Top-right Settings (Plan, History, Upgrade/Downgrade, Notifications).
Explain how mode (Easy/Standard/Pro) and goal (View/Suggest/Plan) only change landing + density, not the nav.
List keyboard shortcuts for web (arrow tabs, Enter to activate primary CTA).
/docs/responsive.md
Breakpoints:
Mobile: 320–428px (primary) — bottom tabs, sticky CTA, tap targets ≥44×44px, large-text toggle 18–20px.
iPad: 768–1024px — split view (left list/right detail), expanded charts/tables.
Web: ≥1024px — centered max-width, multi-column grids, keyboard focus styles.
Performance: target TTI <2.5s on mid-range phones; defer heavy JS; no layout shift >0.1.
Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA, color-blind-safe palette, ARIA summaries for charts, “View as table” fallback everywhere.
/docs/wireframes.md
ASCII wireframes (Free and Pro) for: Onboarding, Map, Duplicates, Costs, Actions, Settings, Upgrade screens, Plan preview, Final confirm, Progress, Done.
Each wireframe shows the Estimated Savings banner placement and the Upgrade CTA for Free.
/docs/copy.md (final app copy; extremely straightforward)
