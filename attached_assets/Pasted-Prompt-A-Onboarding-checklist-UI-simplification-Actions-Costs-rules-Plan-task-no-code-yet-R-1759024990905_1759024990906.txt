Prompt A — Onboarding checklist + UI simplification + Actions/Costs rules
Plan task (no code yet): Replace onboarding with a persistent checklist and simplify the chrome. Update copies and page behaviors.
Do:
Replace the current onboarding screen with a persistent checklist that sits at the top of every page until all items are done:
Link this device (grant local scan permission)
Link cloud accounts (Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox)
Optimize (run suggestions/plan)
This checklist persists across Map / Duplicates / Costs / Actions until completed; then it collapses to a small “All set” badge with a Refresh connections button.
Remove the left config; keep only two header controls:
Details (button, highlighted when ON; acts as both extra info + tooltips)
Settings (gear icon) — tapping enters/exits the Settings page (no side drawer).
Update landing page copy under “See it all. Clean it all.” to:
“Get a free snapshot of your files across every device and cloud. Then, let us clean it all up and cut your storage costs, automatically.”
Remove the old “Upgrade later…” line.
Costs page: show current plan tier for each provider next to the monthly estimate.
Actions page: every recommendation is selectable even on Free:
If Free tier → selecting items + tapping bottom CTA triggers the Upgrade flow, then returns to Optimize with those items pre-selected.
If Paid tier → selecting items + CTA goes straight to Plan preview → Confirm.
Duplicates page: remove the “cluster” jargon. Use plain categories:
Exact duplicates (same file)
Same photo in multiple clouds
Identical videos
“Details” ON shows hashes and tie-break logic; OFF shows only counts and the Keep here location.
Keep Details OFF by default; when ON, reveal formulas, plan math, and raw numbers inline (no tooltips).
Keep the Refresh connections control in the header (modal with last sync + status).
Deliverables to update: /docs/ux-flow.md, /docs/navigation.md, /docs/wireframes.md, /docs/copy.md.
Acceptance (for this plan step):
Checklist spec appears on all pages with completion rules and collapsed state.
Copies updated exactly as specified.
Costs shows current plan tiers.
Actions selection logic documented for Free vs Paid.
Duplicates uses the three simple categories; “Details” behavior is defined.
