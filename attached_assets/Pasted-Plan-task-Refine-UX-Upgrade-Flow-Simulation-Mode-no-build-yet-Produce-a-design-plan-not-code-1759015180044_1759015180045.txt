Plan task: Refine UX & Upgrade Flow (Simulation Mode — no build yet)
Produce a design plan, not code. Focus on onboarding, free vs. pro tier differentiation, navigation, upgrade flows, and cross-device responsiveness.
Tone & Copy Requirement (important):
All copy across the app must be extremely straightforward, plain, and easy to understand.
No jargon. No clever wordplay. Always say exactly what’s happening, why it matters, and what the user should do next.
Copy must work for all audiences: an 80-year-old non-technical user, a Gen Z phone-native, and a 35-year-old backend engineer.
Onboarding (1 page, 2 questions)
Headline: “See it all. Clean it all.”
Subcopy: “Get a free snapshot of your files across every device and cloud. Then, with one tap, let us clean up duplicates and cut your storage costs automatically.”
Question 1: Familiarity (Easy, Standard, Pro).
Question 2: Goal (View only, Suggestions, Plan).
Bottom CTA: “Continue → See My Storage”.
Small note under CTA: “Upgrade later to let the app fix it all for you.”
Navigation (always the same)
Bottom tabs: Map · Duplicates · Costs · Actions.
Top-right gear icon → Settings (Plan, History, Upgrade/Downgrade).
Free tier experience
Populate all tabs (Map, Duplicates, Costs, Actions) with simulated data.
At the top of each tab, show a big “Estimated Savings” banner (from simulated calculations).
Under every banner: Upgrade CTA → “Start saving now.”
Actions tab: keep it very simple. Show a handful of descriptive recommendations (e.g. “Remove duplicate photos across Google Drive and iCloud”). Each item shows type of dupe, estimated $/mo savings, and a clear explanation.
Recommended action: always highlighted (based on cost, storage savings, and simplicity).
All upgrade CTAs should route to the same Upgrade flow.
Upgrade flow (Pro tier)
Simple subscription choices:
One-time $10 “Clean it once.”
$5/month “Keep it optimized.”
Once upgraded:
User can actually select actions.
Show a step-by-step plan (e.g. “Remove 120 duplicate photos from Drive, move 4 videos >1GB to iCloud archive”).
Let them select/unselect actions.
Show a final confirmation screen.
Optional upsell: pay for a backup of deleted files.
After confirmation: show a progress UI, then “Done” with a summary + savings estimate.
Pro tier account features
History tab in Settings: past actions, storage/cost trend.
Account plan management: upgrade/downgrade.
Notifications toggle (for ongoing monitoring if subscribed).
Cross-device UX (mobile → iPad → web)
Mobile (primary):
Bottom nav tabs, sticky primary CTA, 44px+ tap targets.
Fast transitions, minimal typing, table fallbacks for charts.
iPad:
Use split-view where possible (left nav list, right detail).
Expand charts and tables to take advantage of space.
Still show upgrade CTA clearly.
Web/desktop:
Centered layout, responsive grid with more columns.
Keyboard navigation and larger charts.
All form factors: Must feel sharp, lightweight, and fast — no laggy animations, no clutter. Layout must resize gracefully across breakpoints.
Accessibility & simplicity
Actions tab must not overwhelm. Descriptions in plain English.
Always include a “What this means” section under charts/tables.
Color-blind-safe palette, WCAG AA minimum.
VoiceOver/TalkBack/Screen Reader friendly with ARIA summaries for every chart.
Deliverables (Plan, not code)
/docs/ux-flow.md — user journey from onboarding → free tier → upgrade → pro tier.
/docs/upgrade-flow.md — step-by-step for upgrade, action selection, backup upsell.
/docs/navigation.md — consistent nav + settings structure.
/docs/responsive.md — breakpoints and layout behaviors for mobile, iPad, web.
Wireframe sketches (text-based if needed) showing each tab in free vs. pro.
Example copy blocks for every screen and CTA, written in extremely straightforward, plain language.
Acceptance for this plan task
Produce clear documentation of flows, not implementation.
Show wireframe-level layouts for onboarding, tabs, and upgrade flow.
Call out where upgrade CTAs appear and how they behave in free vs. pro.
Provide suggested copy for each page and button that is direct, simple, and obvious.
Document how layouts adapt across mobile, iPad, and web.
Make sure every design choice emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and one-tap upgrade.
