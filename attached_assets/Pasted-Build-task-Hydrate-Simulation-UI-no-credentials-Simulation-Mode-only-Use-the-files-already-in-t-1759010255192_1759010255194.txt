Build task: Hydrate Simulation UI (no credentials — Simulation Mode only)
Use the files already in the repo to turn the preview into a working simulated app. Do not connect any real providers.
Data & copy
Source of truth: data/fake/files.json
Sample pricing: config/pricing.yaml (show a small “Sample pricing” badge anywhere pricing is shown)
UI text & glossary: i18n/strings.en.json
Onboarding (2 questions) → global app state
Q1 Familiarity → mode: easy | standard | pro
Q2 Goal → goal: view | suggest | plan
Persist answers in memory for this session; users can switch later via a header mode/goal switcher.
Route / landing logic (mode × goal)
Easy × View → land on Map
Easy × Suggest → land on Actions (Savings)
Easy × Plan → land on Plan preview (a read-only checklist under Actions)
Standard × View → land on Overview/Map
Standard × Suggest → land on Actions (list sorted by $/mo savings)
Pro × any → land on Diagnostics (raw tables + transparency panel)
Reorder bottom tabs accordingly and keep a mode/goal chip visible to change at any time.
Views to implement (read from the files above)
Map (Overview)
Provider tiles: provider name, used GB, estimated $/month (from pricing.yaml)
Storage-by-type treemap (images, video, docs, other) with a “View as table” toggle
A short “What this means” paragraph from i18n strings
Duplicates
Group files by hash (already in the data); show cluster size and which providers are involved
Compute a “Keep here” badge using rule: keep on cheapest provider by current pricing, tie-break by newest last_modified
Show counts and a collapsed list of member files per cluster
Costs
Table: provider | plan | used GB | est. $/mo (use pricing.yaml math; two decimals)
Small horizontal bars for quick comparison
Note: display “Sample pricing” badge
Actions (Recommendations)
Build a list from the duplicates and cold-file heuristics:
Dedupe: suggest removing extras in each cluster (keep the computed “Keep here” location)
Cold storage: files ≥ 1 GB and last_modified ≥ 180 days → suggest moving to cheapest “archive-tier” provider
Consolidation: simple heuristic by top-level folder/prefix; suggest a single home
Each item shows Estimated savings $/mo, Friction (Low/Med/High based on item count + provider change), and a Risk note (“Simulation only—no changes made.”)
Show a primary CTA “Plan my savings” but keep it disabled in Simulation Mode; clicking explains it’s a dry-run only
Diagnostics (Pro mode)
Raw tables (files, duplicate clusters, cost rows)
JSON export for current recommendations
Panel showing the heuristic weights/thresholds (read-only)
Mobile/PWA requirements
Treat as a mobile-first PWA: bottom tab bar (Map, Duplicates, Costs, Actions), sticky bottom primary CTA, tap targets ≥ 44×44px
System fonts, safe-area insets, large-text toggle (18–20px body) and color-blind-safe palette
Each chart must have an ARIA summary and a “View as table” fallback
No network calls; everything must run offline on the simulated files
Exports
Add buttons to export or link:
CSV → out/report.csv (if present) or generate equivalent client-side
Markdown → out/report.md (if present) or generate equivalent
PDF → use the printable layout (single page, large text) and save to out/report.pdf if feasible
Disable real integrations
Hide/disable all “Connect provider” prompts (OneDrive, Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
No OAuth, no API calls, no deletes or moves
Acceptance criteria
App boots straight into the two-question onboarding, then routes per the matrix above
All four views render using data/fake/files.json and config/pricing.yaml
Actions list shows $/mo savings and friction badges; primary CTA is visible but disabled with a tooltip/explainer
Mobile preview: comfortable thumbs (≥44px), bottom nav works, large-text toggle works, VoiceOver/TalkBack reads chart summaries
No network requests are made; everything works offline in the Replit preview
Do not
Do not add real adapters or credentials
Do not modify the data schema
Do not enable any destructive actions
When done, show me where to click in the preview to test each mode/goal and how to trigger the exports.
