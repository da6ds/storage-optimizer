Love where you’re steering this. Here’s a tight package: names + visual “Map” concept + how we handle backups/redundancy sanely + an education/walkthrough module — plus a single copy-paste prompt to update your Plan docs.

# Name ideas (with crisp taglines)

Pick one now; we can always alias in the UI.

* **StorageMap** — *See it all. Clean it all.* (clear, literal, pairs with your Map view)
* **SpaceLens** — *A clear view of your files and costs.*
* **StashMap** — *Where your stuff lives, at a glance.*
* **ByteHouse** — *Organize your digital house.*
* **StoreWise** — *Spend less. Store smarter.*
* **DataDeck** — *One dashboard for your files.*
* **Atlas** — *Your files, charted.*

Default in docs if you don’t pick: **StorageMap**.

# Visual Map (toggle: List ▢ / Visual ▣)

**Goal:** make storage understandable at a glance — “my devices here, my clouds up there, what’s on each, what it costs, and where dupes live.”

**Layout (mobile-first)**

* Avatar bubble in center → **Your Devices** (phone, tablet, laptop) as icons below; **Cloud services** (Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox) as icons above.
* Each node shows:

  * **Used** (GB) + **% full**
  * **Est. $/mo** (for clouds)
  * Tiny legend for file-type mix (photos/videos/docs/other)
* **Edges** (lines):

  * Thickness = number of files that “link” (backed up/synced) between nodes.
  * **Duplicate arcs** drawn in a dotted style; tap to open the cluster.
* **Heat tint** on nodes with waste (many dupes / cold bulk).
* **Score gauge** pinned top-right: **Storage Health 0–100** with “What this means”.
* Switch at top: **List | Visual** (remembers choice).

**Interactions**

* Tap a node → drawer: Top files, “waste” breakdown, **Recommended action** chip.
* Tap a duplicate arc → list of files in the cluster + “Keep here” badge (cheapest/newest rule).
* Long-press node → “Refresh this provider”.

# Redundancy done right (people like backups!)

We embrace redundancy; we just make it **intentional** and **cheap**.

**Redundancy Plan (plain-English presets)**

* **Essential (1+1)** — *One main copy + one backup.* Cheapest; good for most people.
* **Balanced (1+2)** — *Main + two backups (one cold).* For photo hoarders.
* **Paranoid (1+3)** — *Main + three backups across providers.* For belt-and-suspenders folks.

**Controls (in Settings → Backup)**

* **Copies slider:** Keep **2–4 copies** of important stuff.
* **What counts as “important”**: starred folders, photos, tax docs (toggleable).
* **Hot vs Cold:** “Keep backups in cheaper archive storage when possible.”
* **Budget:** “Keep my total storage under **$X/mo**” (we optimize to that cap).

**Engine changes (simple, fair math)**

* Suggestions never drop you below your chosen copies count.
* If deduping would violate backup count, we convert the extra copies into **cheaper backups** (e.g., move to archive tier) instead of deleting.
* Savings are shown **after** honoring your redundancy target.
* We show **where your backups live** on the Visual Map (light halo rings around nodes).

**Education touchpoints**

* Every recommendation includes a one-liner: *“You’ll still have 2 copies after this change.”*
* A small **“Why keep backups?”** link explains “hot vs cold” and recovery basics in two sentences.

# Education / Guided Setups (per provider)

**Tab: Learn** (or inside Actions → “How to set this up”)

* Tiny lessons with checklists and deep links. Tone: brutally clear.

**Templates (we’ll auto-fill specifics per platform)**

* **iOS / iPadOS Photos**

  1. Open **Settings → Photos**
  2. Turn on **iCloud Photos**
  3. Choose **Optimize iPhone Storage** (keeps originals in iCloud, frees device space)
  4. Verify: Photos app shows a cloud badge
* **macOS Photos (optimize)**

  1. Photos → Settings → **iCloud**
  2. Enable **iCloud Photos** and **Optimize Mac Storage**
* **Google Photos (Android/iOS)**

  1. Google Photos → Profile → **Photos settings**
  2. **Back up**: On · **Upload size**: Storage saver
* **Google Drive (desktop app)**

  1. Install Drive for desktop → **Stream files** (not Mirror) for space savings
* **OneDrive (Windows/macOS)**

  1. OneDrive Settings → **Files On-Demand**: On
* **Dropbox**

  1. Dropbox app → Preferences → **Smart Sync**: Automatic

Each guide ends with **“Mark as done”** → we **Refresh** and update **Score** + **Estimated savings**.

# Fix the unrealistic savings

* Cap monthly savings at **40%** of current cost unless a plan downgrade is provably available.
* Don’t double-count bytes (dedupe vs downgrade).
* Apply small **migration overhead** when moving large files to archive tiers.
* Treat redundancy targets as constraints before calculating savings.

# What to paste to Agent (updates the plan docs cleanly)

**Prompt 1 — rename + Visual Map + redundancy + education**

> **Plan update (no code):**
> Adopt the product name **StorageMap** in all docs. Replace the 2-question onboarding with **one question**: “What do you want to do today?” (View · Suggestions · Plan). Add a persistent **Details** toggle in the header to show/hide technical info.
> Add a **Visual Map** view alongside List: avatar, device nodes (local), cloud nodes (services), edges sized by linkage, dotted arcs for duplicates, heat tint for waste, Score gauge. Document interactions (tap node, tap duplicate arc, long-press to refresh).
> Introduce **Redundancy Plan** presets (Essential 1+1, Balanced 1+2, Paranoid 1+3) with controls: Copies (2–4), Important content toggles, Hot vs Cold, and a monthly **Budget** cap. Ensure the engine honors the chosen copies before making suggestions.
> Add an **Education/Guides** section with per-provider checklists (iOS Photos Optimize, macOS Photos Optimize, Google Photos Storage Saver, Drive Stream files, OneDrive Files On-Demand, Dropbox Smart Sync). Each guide ends with “Mark as done” → triggers **Refresh** and recalculates Score/Savings.
> Update wireframes and copy to include: **Refresh connections** button with last sync time, **Success** state after cleanup, and **Storage Health Score** (0–100) with a short explainer.

**Prompt 2 — realistic savings rules**

> **Plan tweak (savings realism):**
> Cap monthly savings at **40%** of current cost unless a cheaper plan is available post-cleanup; no double counting between dedupe and plan changes; subtract a small migration overhead for archive moves; compute “optimal plan” as the smallest tier that fits post-cleanup usage with **15% headroom**. Recompute examples in docs accordingly.

If you want, I’ll also draft the exact **copy blocks** for the Visual Map tooltips, the Redundancy presets, and the Success page so you can drop them straight into your `strings.en.json`.
