Proceed with Plan — finalize docs using these defaults (no code):
Priorities & defaults
Primary device: Mobile first; then iPad; then web.
Free tier data: Show complete simulated data (no paywalls on visibility). All actions are read-only with Upgrade CTAs everywhere savings appear.
Upgrade flow: In-app checkout with two options: $10 one-time (“Clean it once”) or $5/month (“Keep it optimized”).
Copy style: Extremely straightforward. No jargon. Every screen explains what’s happening, why it matters, what to do next.
Navigation: Always Map · Duplicates · Costs · Actions. Gear icon → Settings (Plan, History, Upgrade/Downgrade, Notifications).
Deliverables to create now (in this order)
/docs/ux-flow.md — end-to-end journey (Onboarding → Free snapshot → Upgrade → Pro actions → Done).
/docs/upgrade-flow.md — one-tap upgrade: pricing choose → confirm → payment → success → enable actions → backup upsell.
/docs/navigation.md — tabs stay fixed; mode/goal only changes landing & density.
/docs/responsive.md — mobile/iPad/web breakpoints + layout rules (thumb reach, split view on iPad, wider tables on web).
/docs/wireframes.md — text wireframes for each state (Free vs Pro) for: Onboarding, Map, Duplicates, Costs, Actions, Settings.
/docs/copy.md — final plain-language copy for headlines, subcopy, banners, CTA labels, tooltips, “What this means” blurbs.
Lock the two-question onboarding
Headline: See it all. Clean it all.
Subcopy: Get a free snapshot of your files across every device and cloud. Then, with one tap, let us clean up duplicates and cut your storage costs automatically.
Q1 (Familiarity): Easy · Standard · Pro
Q2 (Goal): View only · Suggestions · Plan
Primary CTA: Continue → See My Storage
Footnote: Upgrade later to let the app fix it all for you.
Free tier rules (show value, nudge upgrade)
At the top of every tab, show an Estimated Savings banner derived from simulated math.
Under the banner, a single CTA: Start saving now → opens Upgrade flow.
Actions tab shows a short, clear list only (3–5 items max):
Duplicates (name the type: exact file matches, same photo in multiple clouds, identical videos, etc.)
Cold files (≥1 GB, inactive ≥180 days) → archive suggestion
Consolidation (scatter from a project folder)
Each item shows: Estimated savings $/mo, Space to free, Friction (Low/Med/High), and a one-sentence explanation.
Highlight Recommended action (balance of savings, space, simplicity).
Pro tier rules
After upgrade, enable selection checkboxes on Actions.
Plan preview page: show exactly what will happen, allow deselecting items.
Final confirm with summary.
Optional Backup add-on: “Back up anything we delete” with a clear price.
Progress screen → Done screen with savings summary and “View history”.
Settings (always available)
Plan & Billing (upgrade/downgrade), History (past actions + trends), Notifications (for $5/mo), App preferences.
Cross-device polish
Mobile: bottom nav, sticky primary CTA, ≥44px tap targets, color-blind safe, ARIA chart summaries, “View as table” toggles.
iPad: split view (left list, right detail), more columns, persistent savings banner + CTA.
Web: centered wide layout, keyboard shortcuts, denser tables.
Performance: snappy feel; avoid heavy animations; keep interactions instant.
Provide concrete content in /docs/copy.md (use these exact strings)
Savings banner (free):
Title: You could save about $XX/month
Body: These suggestions are safe previews. Upgrade to apply them automatically.
CTA: Start saving now
Actions item labels:
Duplicates: Remove exact duplicate photos across Google Drive and iCloud
Cold files: Move large, rarely opened videos to archive storage
Consolidation: Keep project files in one place
Free action chips: “Estimated savings”, “Space to free”, “Friction”, “Simulation only”
Upgrade options:
$10 one-time — Clean it once
$5/month — Keep it optimized
Upgrade success: You’re set. Let’s clean things up.
Subcopy: You can review and unselect items before we start.
Acceptance for this Plan task
Produce all six docs above with wireframes and the exact copy blocks.
Make explicit where upgrade CTAs appear on each tab and how they behave in Free vs Pro.
Show how layouts adapt at mobile (primary), iPad, and web breakpoints.
Keep every sentence simple and direct.
